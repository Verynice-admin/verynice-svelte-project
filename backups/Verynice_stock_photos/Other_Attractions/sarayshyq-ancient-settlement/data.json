    "content": "\n# Sarayshyq: The Medieval Capital of the Golden Horde (2026 Guide)\n\nLocated 50km from modern Atyrau, Sarayshyq was once one of the most important cities of the Silk Road and the capital of the Golden Horde. Built on the banks of the Ural River, it was a gateway between Europe and the East, described by travelers like Ibn Battuta as a city of immense wealth and luxury.\n\n## A Legacy Beneath the Silt\nSarayshyq (meaning \"Little Palace\") was famous for its sophisticated water systems, its silver mint, and its role as the burial site for seven Khans of the Golden Horde and the Kazakh Khanate. In 2026, the site has been transformed into a modern archaeological park with protective domes that shield the ancient mudbrick walls from the river’s erosion.\n\n## 2026 Experiences\n1.  **The Sarayshyq Museum-Reserve:** Start at the newly built museum complex, which houses artifacts ranging from golden coins to intricate 13th-century ceramics found during the excavations.\n2.  **The Memorial of Seven Khans:** A spiritual site dedicated to the rulers buried here. It is a peaceful place for reflection on the origins of the Kazakh state.\n3.  **Viewing the Excavations:** Walk along the metal bridges overlooking the archaeological trenches to see the 14th-century baths and street layouts.\n\n## Travel Tips\n*   **Access:** A 45-minute drive from Atyrau. Taxis are the easiest way to reach the site.\n*   **Respect:** This is a site of deep historical and spiritual significance. \n",
