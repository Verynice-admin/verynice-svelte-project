    "content": "\n# Aktau: The White City of the Caspian (2026 Guide)\n\nAktau is Kazakhstan’s only seaport on the Caspian Sea and the indispensable gateway to the Mangystau desert. Built from scratch in the 1960s to support the region’s mineral wealth, it has transformed in 2026 into a modern coastal hub with a unique desert-meets-ocean aesthetic.\n\n## The Seaside Vibe\nThe city is unique for its \"District\" system—there are no street names, only numbers. District 15 is the heart of the new seaside promenade, which in 2026 features the **\"Rocky Path\"**—a multi-kilometer elevated walkway built directly into the limestone cliffs of the shore.\n\n## 2026 Infrastructure\n*   **The Tourism Corridor:** New paved roads have reduced the transit time to the **Valley of Balls** and **Tuzbair Salt Flats** by 25%.\n*   **Caspian Recreation:** The \"Rixos Water World\" and \"Wyndham Garden\" have established Aktau as a luxury beach destination, independent of its role as a desert base.\n\n## Activities\n1.  **Sunset at the Rocky Path:** The lighthouse atop an apartment building in District 4 is a local landmark.\n2.  **Caspian Swimming:** The water is refreshing and less salty than the ocean. The best public beaches are in District 1.\n3.  **Gateways to the Plateau:** Use Aktau as your base for 3-day expeditions into the Ustyurt Plateau.\n\n## Practical Tips\n*   **Water:** Tap water is desalinated and not recommended for drinking. Use bottled or filtered water.\n*   **Logistics:** The airport (SCO) has direct links to Istanbul, Baku, and Tbilisi, making it a great entry point for international travelers.\n",
