Its colossal, perfectly spherical glass shell—the architectural centerpiece of the former Expo 2017—is a stunning feat of modern engineering that instantly dominates the Astana skyline. Representing the nation's unwavering commitment to \"Future Energy,\" this transparent, immaculate orb stands as a beacon of innovation, its shimmering surface reflecting the vast Central Asian skies and serving as a powerful architectural metaphor for ambition, technological progress, and a bold embrace of 21st-century design principles.\n\nStepping inside Nur Alem is an ascent into tomorrow. The eight innovative floors within guide visitors through a carefully curated journey dedicated to solar, wind, biomass, and kinetic power, transforming complex energy concepts into interactive, immersive experiences. As guests climb to the uppermost level, they look out across the rapidly evolving city, realizing that this gleaming structure is more than an exhibition space; it is a tangible blueprint for a sustainable global future, inspiring every viewer to imagine a world powered by clean innovation and boundless human ingenuity.",

Designed by the renowned Chicago firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture (AS+GG), the structure is the largest spherical building in the world, measuring 80 meters in diameter and 100 meters in height, with a distinct, crystalline glass facade that reflects the vast Central Asian sky. Its form was conceptualized not merely as an exhibition space but as a representation of sustainable energy, aligning with the Expo’s theme, \"Future Energy.\" After the conclusion of Expo 2017, the Nur Alem Sphere was successfully repurposed into the Museum of Future Energy, preserving its cultural function and ensuring its lasting importance within the rapidly developing skyline of the capital city.\n\nArchitecturally, the Nur Alem Sphere showcases cutting-edge sustainable design and engineering, making it a critical example of modern Kazakh architecture. The sphere houses eight distinct levels, each dedicated to a different aspect of energy—such as space, solar, wind, and kinetics—culminating in an observation deck that provides panoramic views of the adjacent business district and surrounding Expo grounds. Furthermore, the building is an active experiment in energy efficiency: its curved glass exterior integrates photovoltaic cells and wind turbine technology, generating a portion of its own power, while internal systems maximize natural light and thermal performance. This blend of monumental scale, sustainable technology, and didactic interior programming firmly establishes the Nur Alem Sphere not only as a global architectural marvel but also as a powerful educational beacon defining Kazakhstan's commitment to ecological innovation.",
