# Console Warnings Explained

## ✅ All Warnings Are Non-Critical

Your page is **working correctly**! These are just informational warnings:

### 1. "Tracking Prevention blocked access to storage" ⚠️
**What it is:** Microsoft Edge's privacy feature blocking third-party storage access  
**Impact:** None - Images still load and display correctly  
**Why:** Edge's tracking prevention blocks Cloudinary from accessing browser storage (cookies/localStorage)  
**Action:** None needed - This is expected browser behavior and doesn't affect functionality

### 2. "Images loaded lazily and replaced with placeholders" ℹ️
**What it is:** Browser optimization message  
**Impact:** None - This is actually good for performance  
**Why:** Modern browsers lazy-load images to improve page speed  
**Action:** None needed - This is normal and beneficial

### 3. Google Maps Warnings ⚠️
**What they are:** Deprecation notices from Google  
**Impact:** None - Maps still work perfectly  
**Why:** Google is recommending newer APIs, but old ones still work  
**Action:** Can be updated later (not urgent)

### 4. Debug Logs (Removed) ✅
**What they were:** Console logs showing sections loading  
**Status:** Removed - No longer needed since everything works
